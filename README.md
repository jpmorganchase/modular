# modular

`modular` allows you to develop and deploy applications, written as JavaScript
modules, across multiple repositories.

It consists of a few parts:

- a spec for tracking and resolving dependencies
- a development server to write and debug code locally
- a tool to build and deploy these assets
- documentation and guidance
