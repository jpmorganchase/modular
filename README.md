[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?)](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
![Build](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

`modular` is a collection of tools and guidance to enable UI development at
scale. It is derived from work at JP Morgan to enable development in a single
repository by many teams.

It provides a `modular` CLI to scaffold and develop a new application from
scratch, as well as commands to add and manage further modules.

## Philosophy

`modular` believes the burden to learn a "Framework" with proprietary APIs in a
rapidly evolving landscape is an inhibitor to **scaled web engineering**.

There is already a very strong set of **Language Constructs, Frameworks and
Tooling** that the front end community is rallying around like `TypeScript`,
`ES6 Modules`, `React`, `Parcel`, `Webpack`, `GitHub Actions`, `Jest`,
`Workspaces` etc.

Scaled Engineering requires a few more Frameworks, Libraries and Tools that are
not yet first class citizens in the world of Front End Engineering like
**Universal Data Fetching**, **Feature Flags**, **Analytics Capture**,
**Security**, **Deployment** etc.

`modular` attempts to bring the best Language Constructs, Libraries, Frameworks
and Tooling together to establish a set of patterns and definitions to enable
**Monorepo** based engineering.

## Getting Started

```bash
  yarn create modular-react-app my-new-modular-project
```

Bootstraps a new project, configured to use
[Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

This also creates a workspace named 'app' containing a fresh
[`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) application written in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Commands
