# `non-modular-buildable`

This is a [Modular Source package](https://modular.js.org/package-types/source)

# Build

Source packages cannot be built; the
[`build`](https://modular.js.org/commands/build.md) command will ignore them
without throwing an error, to allow for selective builds to still succeed if
their dependency graph contains one or more `source` packages.

## Start

Source package cannot be started; attempting to do so will cause Modular to
throw an error.

## Entry-point

Source packages are imported from their source files directly, so they don't
have the concept of "entry-point".

## Template

Sources are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-source`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-source)
[template](https://modular.js.org/package-types/template.md).
