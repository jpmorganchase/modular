# Workspaces

This is the default
[workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) root created
by Create Modular React App. Packages added by the
[`modular add`](https://modular.js.org/commands/add/) command will be located
here by default, unless a different directory (included in the root
package.json's
[`workspaces` field](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/#toc-how-to-use-it))
is specified using the `--path` option.
