# `PackageName__`

This is a [Modular App](https://modular.js.org/package-types/app)

## Build

To [build](https://modular.js.org/commands/build) your app for deployment, run:

```bash
modular build PackageName__
```

The resulting output is an optimized site that can be served statically. All
code (files in `src` plus external dependencies required in the code) is bundled
in a single blob of code that can be split in different files.

## Start

To run your app locally on a development server, run
[start](https://modular.js.org/commands/start):

```bash
modular start PackageName__
```

This causes a developer server to run on port 3000, serving the app with an
additional runtime layer that provides developer experience functionalities like
hot reloading and on-screen error overlay.

## Entry-point

Apps need an entry-point file located at `src/index.tsx`, which typically uses
React to render components to the DOM, generated at `public/index.html`.

## Template

Apps are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-app`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-app)
[template](https://modular.js.org/package-types/template).
