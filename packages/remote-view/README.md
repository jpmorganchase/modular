# `@modular-scripts/remote-view`

This is a [Modular Package](https://modular.js.org/package-types/package)

## Build

To [build](https://modular.js.org/commands/build.md) your package for
deployment, run:

```bash
modular build @modular-scripts/remote-view
```

When building a `package`, Modular transpiles it starting from its entry-point
twice: once with a target format of
[CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) in the `dist-cjs` directory and
once with a target format of
[ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules),
in the `dist-es` directory. The output `package.json` links both compiled
entry-points respectively in the
[`main`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#main) and
[`module`](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/master/proposal.md)
field.

## Start

Modular `package` is a generic type that doesn't necessarily export an UI
Component; for this reason, it can't be previewed locally, and the
[`start`](https://modular.js.org/commands/start.md) command fails when invoked
on a package. For a similar type that can be started, see [`view`](./view.md).

## Entry-point

The entry-point for a package is configurable; Modular discovers it by looking
at the `main` field in the package's `package.json`; by default,
`modular add`ing a new package sets it as `"./src/index.ts"`, but it's possible
to manually modify it.

## Template

Packages are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-package`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-package)
[template](https://modular.js.org/package-types/template.md).
