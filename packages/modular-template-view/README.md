# `PackageName__`

This is a `Modular View`(https://modular.js.org/package-types/view)

# View

Modular `view`s are Modular
[`package`s](https://modular.js.org/package-types/package.md) that, by
convention, export a default React component. They are
[created](https://modular.js.org/commands/add.md) with a default entry-point of
`src/index.tsx` in their `package.json` and they are built exactly like
[`package`](https://modular.js.org/package-types/package.md) types. The only
difference is that, since `view`s should always export a React component, they
can be [`start`ed](https://modular.js.org/commands/start.md) to spawn a local
developer server and render their default export to the DOM.

## Build

To [build](https://modular.js.org/commands/build.md) your View for deployment,
run:

```bash
modular build PackageName__
```

When building a `view`, Modular transpiles it starting from its entry-point
twice: once with a target format of
[CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) in the `dist-cjs` directory and
once with a target format of
[ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules),
in the `dist-es` directory. The output `package.json` links both compiled
entry-points respectively in the
[`main`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#main) and
[`module`](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/master/proposal.md)
field.

## Start

To run your view locally on a development server, run
[start](https://modular.js.org/commands/start.md):

```bash
modular start PackageName__
```

This causes a developer server to run on port 3000, serving the default export
of the View entry-point with an additional runtime layer that provides developer
experience functionalities like hot reloading and on-screen error overlay.

## Entry-point

The entry-point for a View is configurable; Modular discovers it by looking at
the `main` field in the View's `package.json`; by default, `modular add`ing a
new view sets it as `"./src/index.tsx"`, but it's possible to manually modify
it. The entry-point of a View needs to export a React component as default for
the `start` command to work.

## Template

Views are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-view`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-view)
[template](https://modular.js.org/package-types/template.md).
