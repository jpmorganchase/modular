# `PackageName__`

This is a `Modular ESM View`(https://modular.js.org/package-types/esm-view)

## Build

To [build](https://modular.js.org/commands/build) your ESM View for deployment,
run:

```bash
modular build PackageName__
```

The resulting output is an optimized site that can be served statically or
imported at run-time using
[dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import).
All code (files in `src` plus external dependencies required in the code) is
bundled in a single blob of code that can be split in different files, except
for external dependencies that are re-written to an ESM CDN (this behaviour is
[configurable](https://modular.js.org/configuration)).

## Start

To run your ESM View locally on a development server, run
[start](https://modular.js.org/commands/start):

```bash
modular start PackageName__
```

This causes a developer server to run on port 3000, serving the ESM View with an
additional runtime layer that provides a trampoline module to load the generated
files, plus developer experience functionalities like hot reloading and
on-screen error overlay. Please make sure that your ESM View entry-point exports
a React component as default for this to work.

## Entry-point

ESM-Views need an entry-point file located at `src/index.tsx`, which typically
exports a React component as default for the synthetically generated
`index.html` and the `start` command to work.

## Template

ESM Views are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-esm-view`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-esm-view)
[template](https://modular.js.org/package-types/template).
