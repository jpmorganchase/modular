- deb2f5c: Bump @babel/core from 7.14.8 to 7.15.0
- 9046031: Modular lint should not check for diffed files if regex is passed in.
  If there are no files that meet the extension criteria (ts, tsx, js, jsx),
  then end the lint.
- 8eb370b: Fix false positive modular project root error on Windows.
- 4a8a40c: Uses the param case version of the targeted app of `modular port` and
  `modular convert` to create the folder in `packages` directory. Ensures
  uniformity between all commands when creating new workspaces in the repo.

  `modular port` will check to confirm that there is a `package.json` file in
  the targeted react-app directory before proceeding with the port. The
  package.json holds key information, such as `name`, `dependencies`,
  `devDependencies`, and `browserslist`, that modular uses to create and resolve
  the new app workspace.
