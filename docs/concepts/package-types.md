# App

Modular `app`s are Typescript and React-based Single Page Applications (SPA)
built with Webpack 5 (by default) or Esbuild (by turning on `useModularEsbuild`
in [the configuration](../configuration.md)). Apps are generated by
`modular add` using the
[`modular-template-app`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-app)
[template](../concepts/templates.md) and need at least a `public/index.html`
file and an entrypoint located in `src/index.tsx` to work.
