# App

Modular `app`s are Typescript and React-based Single Page Applications (SPA)
built with [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/) (by default) or
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (by turning on `useModularEsbuild` in
[the configuration](../configuration.md)).

Apps are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-app`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-app)
[template](../concepts/templates.md) and need at least a `public/index.html`
file and an entrypoint located in `src/index.tsx`, that typically `render`s a
React component to the DOM, to work.

Apps support pretty much all the functionalities from
[Create React App v5](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates), with
some important differences:

- [ejecting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)
  is not supported
- [template support](../concepts/templates.md) is integrated in the
  [`modular add`](../commands/add.md) command. Modular templates are not
  guaranteed to be compatible with CRA templates.
- Source files are loaded with the more performant
  [`esbuild-loader`](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader) in the
  Webpack configuration, and Babel plugins are not supported.
- [Local proxies](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/)
  are supported, but [esbuild mode](../configuration.md) doesn't support the
  `package.json` `proxy` field. The more flexible
  [manual proxy configration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#configuring-the-proxy-manually)
  is supported in both Webpack and esbuild mode.

Apps can be built using [`modular build`](../commands/build.md): the resulting
output is an optimized site that can be served statically. All code (files in
`src` plus external dependencies required in the code) are bundled in a single
blob of code that can be split in different files.

Apps can be started using [`modular start`](../commands/start.md): a developer
server runs on port 3000, serving the app with an additional runtime layer that
provides developer experience functionalities like hot reloading and on-screen
error overlay.

# ESM View

Modular `esm-view`s are similar to `app`s with a number of important
differences: they are compiled as ES Modules and all their external `import`s
are rewritten to point to an [ESM CDN](../esm-views/esm-cdn.md). Like apps, they
are be built with the same Webpack or esbuild configuration and support the same
functionality. Unlike apps, they don't allow the user to specify a custom
`index.html`, they don't support the `public` folder and they expect their
entrypoint (`src/index.tsx`) to not `render` to the DOm, but to export
something, typically a React Component.

Esm Views are Modular's type of choice to implement the
[micro-frontend](../concepts/microfrontends.md) pattern. They typically expect
their entrypoint exports to be
[dynamically `import`ed at runtime](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import)
by some other micro-frontend, but can be also
[served standalone](../esm-views/how-to-build.md) exactly as an `app`, provided
that they default export a React component that can be rendered to the DOM.

Since the micro-frontend pattern allows different teams to build and serve their
applications independently and compose them at runtime (parallelizing otherwise
expensive build operations), third-party dependencies need to be de-duplicated
across micro-frontends; for this reason, external dependencies are not bundled,
but they are rewritten to a [configurable ESM CDN](../esm-views/esm-cdn.md) that
serves them as ES modules on the fly.

Esm Views can be built using [`modular build`](../commands/build.md): the
resulting output is an optimized site that can be either served statically
(using a synthetically-generated `index.html` file and a `_trampoline.js`
loader), or dynamically imported by another ESM view. The js and CSS
entrypoints, in the second case, are linked in the
[generated manifest file](../esm-views/output-package-manifest.md), that the
loading application can fetch and examine before loading the `esm-view`. When
building an ESM View, all "local" code (files in `src`) is bundled in a single
blob that can be split into different files. All external dependencies are
rewritten to an external CDN by default and don't get bundled, although this
behavior is [configurable](../configuration.md).
