# Modular 2.2.0

## Support for react-error-overlay with esbuild

[react-error-overlay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-overlay) is now
shown when running `modular start` in esbuild mode, if the application fails to
compile or throws a runtime exception.

## Support for web workers in esbuild

[Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)
are supported in esbuild mode. See [the documentation for in-depth
info](../building-apps/web workers).

## Same output file structure for builds in esbuild and webpack

- CSS file generation moved `/static/css/*` instead of `/static/js`
- `modular build` now produces hashed asset names for cache busting via esbuild
  hashing API.
