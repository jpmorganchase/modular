# Modular 3.2.0

- Add support for `compilerOptions.jsx` in `tsconfig.json`
- New internals: we've added some new internal packages
  (`@modular-scripts/modular-types` and `@modular-scripts/workspace-resolver`)
  as we move towards (a) a more yarn-agnostic approach and (b) ghost testing
  features. More will follow on this in subsequent releases.
