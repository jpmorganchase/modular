# Modular 2.1.0

## Allow certain commands and flags to be run outside of a modular directory

Before 2.1.0, some of the commands and standalone flags erroneously terminated
earlier if invoked outside a subdirectory of a modular project. We corrected
this in 2.1.0 and now, the `--help` and `--version` standalone flags and the
`init`, `help` and `convert` commands can be run from anywhere in the file
system. This is especially important for commands that are actually supposed to
be invoked from within a non-modular subdirectory, like `init` and `convert`,
and also allows users to invoke help and check their installed version from
anywhere in the filesystem.

## Hide yarn warnings by default

With the relase of 2.1.0 we will start hiding warning-level messages generated
by the execution of underlying yarn processes by default, in order to improve
user experience and avoid presenting them with pages of non-relevant information
when they're using modular. Warning messages are still visible by specifying the
`--verbose` flag.

# Merged Changes

- [#1026](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/pull/1026) Allow the `--help`
  and `--version` flags and the `init`, `help` and `convert` commands to work
  without necessarily being run inside a modular directory.
