# Modular 4.0.0 (IN PROGRESS, EDIT BEFORE RELEASE)

## New Features

- Node 18 Support
- Updated Jest to [^29.3.1](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases)
- Support for a dedicated [Modular configuration file](../configuration.md)

## Breaking Changes

### Upgraded to Jest 29

Jest has been bumped up three major versions from Jest 26, and it comes with a
number of breaking changes.

We suggest reading through the following migration guides:

- [Jest 26 to 27 Change Log](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v27.0.0)
- [Jest 27 to 28 Migration Guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/28.x/upgrading-to-jest28)
  | [Change log](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v28.0.0)
- [Jest 28 to 29 Migration Guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/next/upgrading-to-jest29)
  | [Change log](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v29.0.0)

Some noteworthy breaking changes:

- Changed default snapshot formatting options to {escapeString: false,
  printBasicPrototype: false} as outlined by
  [this blogpost](https://jestjs.io/blog/2022/04/25/jest-28#future) - Any
  snapshots tests will have to be updated with the new format, or you can
  override the snapshotFormat option to the old defaults.
- As of Jest 28 Jest-Environment-JSDOM is no longer shipped with Jest and needs
  to be installed separately
- Jest now includes full support of package.json exports - some existing imports
  might not resolve correctly

### Upgraded to ESLint 8

ESLint has been bumped up from version 7 to 8. As with all major version
changes, read through their
[migration guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/migrating-to-8.0.0)
for more information.

The biggest impact will likely be linting errors from new rules introduced with
the update.

### Removed Commands

We no longer provide the following commands:

- `modular convert `
- `modular init`
- `modular port`
- `modular rename`

Refer to the [How To](../how-to/index.md) section for instructions on how to
manually complete the tasks previously covered by these commands.

### Other

- Jest `--watchAll` flag when running modular test is now `false` by default
  (Previously set to true unless running in CI)
- Dropped support for minor versions of Node 14.17 and Node 16 version 16.9 and
  below
  - Now support Node ^14.18.0, >=16.10.0, and >=18.0.0
- Dropped `USE_MODULAR_WEBPACK` environment variable, as Webpack is used by
  default. Use `USE_MODULAR_ESBUILD` env variable or `useModularEsbuild` in a
  [modular configuration file](../configuration.md) to use esbuild
- Changed default Content Delivery Network for ESM Views to esm.sh instead of
  Skypack, as it is no longer actively maintained. The CDN can still be
  configured through the `EXTERNAL_CDN_TEMPLATE` environment variable or through
  a [modular configuration file](../configuration.md).
