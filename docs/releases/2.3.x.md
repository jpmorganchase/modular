## `modular rename`

The `modular rename` command is available, to rename a package and all its
references in the code.

## ~~Support for yarn v3~~ Support for yarn v3 workspaces

~~modular now supports [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v3~~ Yarn supports limited
features of Yarn v3 (such as v3 workspaces)

code, including hoisted dependencies.
