# View

Modular `view`s are Modular [`package`s](./package.md) that, by convention,
export a default React component. They are [created](../commands/add.md) with a
default entry-point of `src/index.tsx` in their `package.json` and they are
built exactly like [`package`](./package.md) types. The only difference is that,
since `view`s should always export a React component, they can be
[`start`ed](../commands/start.md) to spawn a local developer server and render
their default export to the DOM.

## Build

Same as [`package`](./package.md/#build).

## Start

To run your view locally on a development server, run
[start](../commands/start.md):

```bash
modular start my-view-name
```

This causes a developer server to run on port 3000, serving the default export
of the view entry-point with an additional runtime layer that provides developer
experience functionalities like hot reloading and on-screen error overlay.

## Entry-point

The entry-point for a View is configurable; Modular discovers it by looking at
the `main` field in the View's `package.json`; by default, `modular add`ing a
new view sets it as `"./src/index.tsx"`, but it's possible to manually modify
it. The entry-point of a View needs to export a React component as default for
the `start` command to work.

## Template

Views are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-view`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-view)
[template](./template.md).
