# View

Modular `view`s are Modular [`package`s](./package.md) that, by convention,
export a default React component. They are [created](../commands/add.md) with a
default entry-point is `src/index.tsx` in their `package.json` and they are
built and tested exactly like `package` types. The only difference is that,
since `view`s should always export a React component, they can be
[`start`ed](../commands/start.md) to spawn a local developer server and render
their default export to the DOM.

Views are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-view`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-view)
[template](./template.md)
