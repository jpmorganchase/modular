Modular can build several different kinds of packages. We refer to each package
type as a Modular type, and each has different features. The table below
summarises the compatibility of each Modular type with Modular commands and
details their unique features.

| Type                        | `modular start` | `modular build` | `modular test` | `modular lint` | Custom index / assets      | Bundled                                                    | Entry-point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Will rewrite external dependencies to point to a CDN. | The compiled bundle will use `src/index.tsx` as an entry-point and [link it](../esm-views/output-package-manifest.md) in the output `package.json`; the entry-point needs to export a default (non-named) React component for `modular start`/ [standalone `index.html`](../esm-views/how-to-build.md) to work |
