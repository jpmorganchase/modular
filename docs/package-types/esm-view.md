# ESM View

Modular `esm-view`s are built with the same Webpack or esbuild configuration and
support the same functionalities as Modular [`app`s](./app.md), with the
following essential differences:

1. They are compiled as [ES
   Modules(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)]

1. All their external `import`s are rewritten to point to an
   [ESM CDN](../esm-views/esm-cdn.md).

1. They don't allow the user to specify a custom `index.html`

1. They don't include a `public` folder in the build

1. They expect their entry-point (`src/index.tsx`) to not `render` to the DOM,
   but to export something, typically a React Component.

The `esm-view` type is used for creating
[micro-frontends](../concepts/microfrontends.md). They typically expect their
entry-point exports to be
[dynamically `import`ed at runtime](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import)
by some other micro-frontend, but can be also
[served standalone](../esm-views/how-to-build.md) exactly as an `app`, provided
that they default export a React component that can be rendered to the DOM.

Since the micro-frontend pattern allows different teams to build and serve their
applications independently and compose them at runtime (parallelizing otherwise
expensive build operations), third-party dependencies need to be de-duplicated
across micro-frontends; for this reason, external dependencies are not bundled,
but they are rewritten to a [configurable ESM CDN](../esm-views/esm-cdn.md) that
serves them as ES modules on the fly.

Esm Views can be built using [`modular build`](../commands/build.md): the
resulting output is an optimized site that can be either served statically
(using a synthetically-generated `index.html` file and a `_trampoline.js`
loader), or dynamically imported by another ESM view. The JS and CSS
entry-points, in the second case, are linked in the
[generated manifest file](../esm-views/output-package-manifest.md), that the
loading code can fetch and examine before loading the `esm-view`. When building
an ESM View, all "local" code (files in `src`) is bundled in a single blob that
can be split into different files. All external dependencies are rewritten to an
external CDN by default and don't get bundled, although this behavior is
[configurable](../configuration.md).

ESM Views are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-esm-view`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-esm-view)
[template](./template.md)
