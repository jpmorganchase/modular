# App

Modular `app`s are TypeScript and React-based Single Page Applications (SPAs)
built with [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/) (by default) or
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (by turning on `useModularEsbuild` in
[the configuration](../configuration.md)).

## Supported features

Apps support a subset of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
features that make sense in a monorepo context. See
[this page](../concepts/supported-cra.md) for a detailed list of supported
features.

## Build

To [build](../commands/build.md) your app for deployment, run:

```bash
modular build my-app-name
```

The resulting output is an optimized site that can be served statically. All
code (files in `src` plus external dependencies required in the code) is bundled
in a single blob of code that can be split in different files.

## Start

To run your app locally on a development server, run
[start](../commands/start.md):

```bash
modular start my-app-name
```

This starts a developer server on port 3000, serving the app with an additional
runtime layer that provides developer experience functionalities like hot
reloading and on-screen error overlay.

## Entry-point

Apps need an entry-point file located at `src/index.tsx`, which typically uses
React to render components to the DOM, generated at `public/index.html`.

## Template

Apps are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-app`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-app)
[template](./template.md).
