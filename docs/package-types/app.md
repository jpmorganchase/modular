# App

Modular `app`s are TypeScript and React-based Single Page Applications (SPAs)
built with [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/) (by default) or
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (by turning on `useModularEsbuild` in
[the configuration](../configuration.md)).

Apps support pretty much all the functionalities from
[Create React App v5](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates), with
some important differences:

- [ejecting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)
  is not supported. As an opinionated tool, Modular tries to offer an uniform
  way of building applications, although feedback on our build configuration is
  welcome!
- [template support](../package-types/template.md) is integrated in the
  [`modular add`](../commands/add.md) command. Modular templates are not
  guaranteed to be compatible with CRA templates.
- Source files are loaded with the more performant
  [`esbuild-loader`](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader) in the
  Webpack configuration. For this reason, Babel plugins are not supported.
- [Local proxies](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/)
  are supported, but [esbuild mode](../configuration.md) doesn't support the
  `package.json` `proxy` field. The more flexible
  [manual proxy configration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#configuring-the-proxy-manually)
  is supported in both Webpack and esbuild mode.

## Build

To [build](../commands/build.md) your app for deployment, run:

```bash
modular build my-app-name
```

The resulting output is an optimized site that can be served statically. All
code (files in `src` plus external dependencies required in the code) is bundled
in a single blob of code that can be split in different files.

## Start

To run your app locally on a development server, run
[start](../commands/start.md):

```bash
modular start my-app-name
```

This causes a developer server to run on port 3000, serving the app with an
additional runtime layer that provides developer experience functionalities like
hot reloading and on-screen error overlay.

## Entry-point

Apps need an entry-point file located at `src/index.tsx`, which typically uses
React to render components to the DOM, generated at `public/index.html`.

## Template

Apps are generated by `modular add` using the
[`modular-template-app`](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/tree/main/packages/modular-template-app)
[template](./template.md).
