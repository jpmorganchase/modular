# Contributing

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By
contributing to **Modular**, you agree to abide by the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/issues) to make sure
your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to **Modular**
itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to
discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a
topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous
discussion.

### Help Us Help You

When raising an issue to discuss, it is a good idea to structure your code and
question in a way that is easy to read to entice people to answer it. For
example, we encourage you to use syntax highlighting, indentation, and split
text in paragraphs.

### Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature
or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your
efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation _is_ to send a
pull request. Use your best judgement!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Open a new issue in the
  [Issue tracker](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/modular/issues).
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the `main` branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including
unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon
as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
